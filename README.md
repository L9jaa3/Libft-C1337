About Libft :
Libft is often the first major project for programming students, particularly in the *1337 = &42 school curriculum. It involves building a custom C library that implements a variety of standard functions, such as those from <string.h>, and sometimes adding more complex utilities to serve as foundational tools for future projects. It teaches:

Low-level understanding of C: Memory management, pointer manipulation, and writing efficient, reusable code.
Discipline in coding standards: Following strict coding rules, like the Norminette, helps write clean, maintainable code.
Problem-solving: Each function, whether ft_strnstr or ft_memmove, encourages logical thinking and understanding edge cases.
Preparation for larger projects: Libft serves as a toolkit that you can use to simplify your work in more complex projects like game engines, web servers, or AI-based applications.
